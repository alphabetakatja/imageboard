# My Analogue Diary Image Board

I've been taking analogue photos for a long time now and I was never really sure what to do with them.
This project is very dear to me because, except from learning Vue.js, I managed to find a special place to store most of my photos.

## Overview

This is Instagram inspired image board where anybody can upload an analogue picture of their choice and see pictures that others have uploaded.

## Features

This application doesn't require registration, but users can add an image along with the title, description and username

There is a predefined number of pictures shown, more on users request ('see more' button)

Click on a picture opens a modal where anybody can leave a comment
